    <h2 style="color: #a8a878;">Description</h2>
    <p>HACKSAW RIDGE is the extraordinary true story of WWII medic Desmond Doss, played by Andrew Garfield (The Amazing Spiderman), who, in Okinawa during the bloodiest battle of WWII, miraculously saved 75 men in a matter of hours without firing or carrying a gun.

He was the only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon, except the simple prayer he uttered before he single-handedly evacuated the wounded from behind enemy lines, under constant enemy gunfire and artillery bombardment.

Doss' courage and faith won the admiration of his commanders and fellow soldiers, as he saved the lives of the very men who had persecuted him for refusing to carry a gun. He believed the war was just, but to kill under any circumstance was wrong. Doss was labeled the first conscientious objector (he called himself a "conscientious cooperator" as he volunteered) to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.

Hacksaw Ridge was selected by the American Film Institute as the Best Dramatic Fim of 2016.

    <p>The 2005 Jake Gyllennhaal movie Jarhead was directed by Sam Mendes who recently directed another acclaimed war movie, 1917. Though it got mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office, but audience ratings on IMDb show that it is still loved by regular viewers.   
    </p>
    <p>Based on the 2003 memoir of the same name, Jarhead follows a US Marine sniper participating in the Gulf War who struggles with a variety of issues both at home and in the warzone.

    <li>American Sniper (2014).</li>
    <p>Despite its controversies, American Sniper was a massive success both for director Clint Eastwood and for lead actor Bradley Cooper. Moreover, it was a massive commercial success and even earned multiple awards and nominations.

    </p>
    <p>Loosely based on a 2012 memoir by Chris Kyle, the story follows Kyle who is a Navy S.E.A.L. sniper who is outstanding at what he does, but once he returns home, he realizes that he can't get rid of the Iraq War.

    <li>Darkest Hour (2017)</li>
    <p>The movie that finally earned Gary Oldman his Academy Award for Best Actor, Darkest Hour saw the actor transforming into one of the most famous historical figures of all time - none other than Winston Churchill himself.

    </p>
    <p>Set during WWII, it follows Churchill depicting his early days as the prime minister of the United Kingdom as he tries to deal with the clashing opinions about whether the country should sign a peace treaty with Adolf Hitler while the Nazis are conquering Europe in 1940.

    <li>Dunkirk (2017)</li>
    <p>Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is an unusual movie and an even more unusual war movie which is probably why it was so successful. It doesn't have a defined antagonist but rather relies on the emotions the characters are feeling. Moreover, it doesn't have a single protagonist, either.

    </p>
    <p>Nolans's story itself is split into three narratives taking place on land, on water, and in the air over one week, one day, and one hour respectively. All the characters involved are actually participating in a historical event - the Dunkirk evacuation of WWII.

    <li>The Pianist (2002)</li>
    <p>Probably one of the most heartbreaking war movies of the recent decades, The Pianist premiered at the Cannes Film Festival where it won the Palme d'Or and went on to be successful critically and commercially and to win multiple awards.

    </p>
    <p>Based on the autobiographical book of the same name, it follows the Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who experiences WWII and lives through the Holocaust.</p>
